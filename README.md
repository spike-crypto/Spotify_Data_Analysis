# Spotify_Data_Analysis
This project analyzes Gesaffelstein and The Weeknd's tracks using data fetched from the Spotify API. It stores key track details like popularity, duration, and album information in a MySQL database and uses Python for data extraction. SQL queries are employed to analyze trends, track performance, and clean up duplicate data.
